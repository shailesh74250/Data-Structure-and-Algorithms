* An algorithms is a procedure having well defined steps for solving a particular problem. Algorithm is finite set of logic or instructions, written in order for accomplish the certain predefined task.
* Algo is not the complete program or code. it is just a solution (logic) of a problem, which can be represented either as an informal description using a Flowchart or Pseudo code.

* Major categories of algo are 
	-> Sort
	-> Search
	-> Delete
	-> Insert
	-> Update
* Performance of algorithm is measured on the basis of following preperties:
	-> Time complexity
	-> Space complexity

example of an algorithm
Q -> Design an algo to multiply the two numbers x and y and display the result in Z.
step1 START
step2 declare three integers x,y & z
step3 define values of x&y
step4 multiply x&y
step5 store output in z
step6 display z
step7 STOP


another way
step1 START MULTIPLY
step2 get values of x&y
step3 z<-x*y
step4 display z
step5 STOP


Characteristics of an Algorithms
* Feasibility -> an algo must be terminated after the finite number of steps.
* independent -> an algo must have step-by-step directions which is independent of any programming code.
* unambiguous -> an algo must be unambiguous and clear. Each of their steps and input/outputs must be clear and lead to only one meaning.
